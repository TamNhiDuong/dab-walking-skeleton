See the top ten average query execution times of queries that have been run more than 5 times:

```sh
SELECT query, mean_exec_time
  FROM pg_stat_statements
  WHERE calls > 5
  ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
```

Studying connection

```sh
SELECT pid, usename, backend_start, query_start, state, query
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state IS NOT null;
```
